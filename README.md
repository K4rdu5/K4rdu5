I'm Lucas a student at Chalmers University of Technology studying Chemical Engineering with Engineering Physics. 

With a newly found passion for "coding"/"programming", I'm digging deeper into the python language to develop a deeper understanding and hone my skills to be able to make innovative and interesting programs. 

My vision: Being able to create awesome projects that explore new areas of interest.
