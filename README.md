I'm K4rdu5 a student at Chalmers University of Technology studying Chemical Engineering with Engineering Physics. 

With a newly found passion for "coding"/"programming", I'm digging deeper into the python language to develop a deeper understanding and hone my skills to be able to make innovative and interesting programs. My vision: Making programs that can help me or others out with various problems.
